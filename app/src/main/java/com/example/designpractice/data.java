Despite their competition-ready configuration, these cars failed to secure significant victories and were largely deprived of any track utilization.[22]\n" +
            "\n" +
            "Serial number 0369GT, the inaugural entry in the Berlinetta Speciale series from 1954, met a tragic fate as it succumbed to destruction in 1958.",
    "The engine was a version of the Ferrari V12 used on earlier 250 GTs, but for 1959 it used the ‘outside plug’ cylinder head with 12 intake ports. Generally this produced 250 to 280 bhp depending on state of tune.\n" +
            "\n" +
            "Early versions had drum brakes while Dunlop discs were used to the model in 1960.\n" +
            "\n" +
            "Like these early 250 GTs, the SWB enjoyed a string of success on the track which led to continual development that culminated with the 250 GTO. Right before the GTO was released, Ferrari was preparing SWBs with very light-gauge aluminum and near 300-horsepower engines for exclusive factory use. Known as the SEFAC hotrods, these were the ultimate derivative of the SWB before being replaced by the much more aerodynamically efficient GTO."};

Lamborghini's Ad Personam division will be responsible for the manufacture of the Sián. The car was officially unveiled to the public at the 2019 Frankfurt Motor Show configured in a unique \"electric gold\" paint. It was also renamed to be known as the Sián FKP 37 honouring late Volkswagen Group chairman Ferdinand Karl Piëch. \"FKP\" are the initials of his name and \"37\" are the last two numbers of his birth year (i.e. 1937).The power for the electric motor is stored in a supercapacitor unit instead of conventional lithium-ion batteries. The supercapacitor unit is integrated with the electric motor into the gearbox for a better weight distribution. A supercapacitor was chosen as it provides three times the power of a conventional lithium-ion battery of the same weight. The unit installed in the car is an evolution of the Aventador's starter motor and can store ten times more power than the unit it is based on. A regenerative braking system helps generate enough energy to recharge the supercapacitors. The electric motor counters the effect of deceleration and provides a power boost to the driver at speeds up to 130 km/h (81 mph). The motor supports low-speed manoeuvres such as parking and reversing."

The design project began in 2000, resulting in the unique combination of formal Lamborghini attributes into an individual unit. The strong aeronautics influence the designers drew inspiration from gave birth to a car that became legendary for its compact athleticism.The path toward the Gallardo officially began in 1998, when the idea of installing a 10-cylinder engine was revisited to create something never seen before in a Lamborghini car. The engine installed on the first Gallardo was a 5-liter, 10-cylinder V90 DOHC with four valves that delivered an output of 500 HP for a state-of-the-art creation. \n" +

    public static String pagani_allmodel_desc[]={"Pagani is the modern supercar maker that blurs the line between automobile and art more than any other. That remains true with the Italian company’s new model, the Utopia, which you are seeing here for the first time. This is a car that would look as natural sitting on a plinth as in a garage.\n" +
            "\n" +
            "While many of the design themes are familiar from the previous Huayra, Pagani promises that the Utopia's structure is entirely new. It was built around three targets set by company founder Horacio Pagani himself: simplicity, lightness, and the pleasure of driving.Company founder Horacio Pagani instructed his team of engineers turned artists to meet three targets for the company’s newest supercar, the Utopia: simplicity, lightness, and the pleasure of driving.The Utopia is unquestionably a masterpiece and guaranteed to be incredibly rare: only 99 Utopia coupes will roll out of the Pagani factory in San Cesario sul Panaro in the province of Modena, Italy."

            ,"One of the last Huayra coupes, the Hermes Edition Pagani Huayra is a 1 of 1 commissioned by Manny Khoshbin.\n" +
            "\n" +
            "It is also the first ever Huayra project designed in collaboration with a luxury brand. Hermes of Paris has added some aesthetic touches to the supercar making it truly unique.The Hermes Edition Pagani Huayra has just been delivered to Manny’s awesome garage in California. The exterior is finished in a dual tone chocolate brown with bare carbon details. Special grille design sets it apart from other special edition Huayras.The Pagani Huayra is among the most unique and sought-after hypercars in the world. With its glorious AMG-sourced twin-turbo V12, and buffet of custom design details, the Italian exotic is already wonderfully unique. But when one of Pagani’s preferred clients came asking for an even more exclusive example of the Huayra, the automaker obliged and created this one-off build with French designer Hermés."

            ,"The Codalunga—Italian for long-tail—was developed by Pagani's Grandi Complicazioni special projects division. It started out as an idea from a single client that, over the course of two years, developed into a small production run of cars. Using the Huayra's dimensions as a base, the Codalunga has a revised fascia and a totally new rear section that sports a rear hatch covering an area over 12 square feet.Pagani first revealed the Huayra, its successor to the legendary Zonda, in 2012. In true Pagani fashion though, the company is still releasing limited-edition and one-off versions of the mid-engine carbon-bodied supercar. The latest version is this, the Huayra Codalunga.The Huayra Codalunga starts from an incredibly reasonable € 7 million, or roughly $7.4 million at current exchange rates. Not that that matters, as all five examples have already been sold. Interestingly, one of the cars was sold to a customer in the U.S., as Pagani says it was able to homologate one car for use on our roads. Hopefully it gets driven rather than stashed away in a collection."

            ,"The 2022 Pagani Huayra R is the spiritual successor to the legendary track-only Zonda R. It's almost an entirely new vehicle, too, but structurally and mechanically it shares more with the Zonda R than it does with any Huayra.\n" +
            "\n" +
            "Specifically, the Huayra R shares just three things with the \"regular\" Huayra: the side mirrors, the Pagani-stamped titanium bolts, and the name. That's it. The Zonda R's engine was an evolution of AMG's 6.0-liter V-12 found in the Mercedes-Benz CLK GTR, as Pagani has a long history with AMG engines dating back to the founder's friendship with fellow Argentine, Mercedes ambassador, and racing legend Juan Manual Fangio. However, the Huayra R's naturally aspirated 6.0-liter V-12 is a clean sheet, or carta bianca, design, built by Germany's HWA, builder of Mercedes DTM race cars.The shape is outlandish. The 2022 Pagani Huayra R is made mostly from Pagani's proprietary Carbo-Titanium HP62 G2 and Carbo-Triax HP62 (the \"HP\" stands for Horacio Pagani). Carbo-Titanium is used in places like the passenger cell where energy absorption is key, whereas Carbo-Triax is used where stiffness is paramount (the drivetrain is mounted to Carbo-Triax). The bodywork is vented everywhere, with scoops, scallops, and slashes wherever your eyes fall. The dual, deep aero channels that begin just aft of the A-pillars and run flat down the top of the body, all the way down to moveable wings flanking the signature encircled quad exhaust pipes, are particularly intriguing. Sorry, I should say the first set of moveable wings, as a second pair made from aluminum are mounted atop the massive, fixed carbon-fiber rear wing."

            ,"The Pagani Zonda HP Barchetta. A creation by Horacio Pagani and his team for Horacio Pagani himself. A tailor-made car that features state of the art technique, perfected by Pagani, combined with handcraftsmanship that is even more sartorial. A tribute to the model that launched Horacio Pagani as a legend of the automotive industry. An object of art, a representation of the Renaissance and science concepts that permeate and fund Pagani’s philosophy. A reinvented masterpiece signed by Horacio Pagani. Pagani Automobili has launched its latest hyper-car the Pagani Zonda HP Barchetta at a price tag of whopping $17.5 million.The Pagani Zonda HP Barchetta is based on mid engined Pagani Zonda which was originally manufactured 19 years ago. The car will not have any any kind of attachable or convertible top and it will give its riders a feel of the natural air while driving at a high speed."

            ,"The $4.0 million Pagani Huayra Roadster BC in the wild is akin to laying eyes on the Mona Lisa. Getting handed the Huayra-shaped key and testing one is like tucking La Gioconda under your arm and making for the exit.Production of all 40 Roadster BC models draws to a close for 2020/2021, with special editions such as the 'Supernova' commissioned by OB Prestige Auto in Canada. The specification of this particular example was picked out with the assistance of Horacio Pagani himself and its exposed carbon-fiber body is finished in a bronze tint called Ora Rosa, complemented by bronze wheels and various red accents."

            ,"The Pagani Huayra is a mid-engine sports car produced by Italian sports car manufacturer Pagani, succeeding the company's previous offering, the Zonda. It is named after Wayra Tata, the Quechua (indigenous South American) wind god. The Huayra was named \"The Hypercar of the Year 2012\" by Top Gear magazin. It is named after Wayra Tata, the Quechua (indigenous South American) wind god.[4][5] The Huayra was named \"The Hypercar of the Year 2012\" by Top Gear magazine. On 11 February 2015 it was reported that the Pagani Huayra has been sold out. The Huayra was limited to just 100 units as part of Pagani's agreement with engine supplier Mercedes-AMG. The Pagani Huayra uses a seven-speed sequential gearbox and a single disc clutch. The choice not to use a dual-clutch was due to the increase in weight of over 70 kg (154 lb), thus negating any advantage of the faster gear changes in a double-clutch transmission. As a result, the transmission weighs 96 kg (212 lb)."

            ,"The Pagani Zonda R is a track day car developed and manufactured by Italian sports car manufacturer Pagani. It debuted at the 2007 Geneva Motor Show, using the 6.0-litre GT 112 engine sourced from the racing version of the Mercedes-Benz CLK-GTR.[2] The Zonda R's competition lies with track-based cars, such as the Ferrari FXX and Maserati MC12 Corsa rather than the original Zonda's road competitors as it is not road-legal.Despite sharing much of the Zonda's shape, the R is almost entirely new, sharing only 10% of the Zonda F's components. It has been obliquely suggested by Horacio Pagani that this car is a testbed chassis for certain components of the Zonda's replacement, the Huayra (in the same vein as the Ferrari 288 GTO Evoluzione and the successive F40) and that the Zonda R accurately reflects some of the Huayra's features. Only 15 Zonda Rs were produced along with an additional 5 Zonda Revolućion cars and the Zonda R prototype."

As the natural surface carbon fibre, the smooth leather and anodized finishes spark the driver’s emotion, this supercar reveals the true character of the Italian GT, which has the sheer privilege of parading elegantly along the esplanade of Montecarlo or screeching its tyres across the Le Mans racing circuit with the same sensuality, aggressive design and mesmeric beauty.Moreover, the staff at the Pagani Zonda Roadster F convey to the client the same love for tradition and the same passion for historic race cars like those driven by the fabulous Fangio, thanks to the great professionalism and attentive care towards interior details, like the Nardi steering wheel in precious wood finished by hand or the new dashboard inspired to the art and craft of antique master clockmakers. Zonda F is an extremely lightweight car, achieved by the utilization of parts made of titanium, aluminium and inconel. The length of the intake manifolds are optimized for more sophisticated power regimes and shapes, thanks to the aid of the Hydroforming technology used in high-pressure moulding."

    public static String Bugatti_allmodel_desc[]={"The Bugatti Mistral, also called the Bugatti W16 Mistral, is a mid-engine two-seater sports car manufactured in Molsheim, France, by French automobile manufacturer Bugatti Automobiles S.A.S. It was revealed on 19 August 2022. The Mistral is marketed as the fastest roadster in the world. Deliveries to customers will begin in early 2024. All 99 units were pre-sold at a price of 5 million euros.The MISTRAL is a one-of-a-kind wind that heralds the new seasons in southern France, stirring awe in all who experience it. The W16 MISTRAL embodies this and the spirit of BUGATTI, offering freedom, elegance, and speed with the incredible power of the iconic W16 engine. Become one with the element. The most intense roofless experience courtesy of the W16 power. With only 99 units produced, never to be replicated, one thing is clear: you’re witnessing automotive history being made.\n\nLAST OF ITS KIND\nThe last road-going model to be produced with the supreme power of the 1600 PS W16 Quad-Turbo, the W16 MISTRAL delivers dizzying high speeds in a body built for winding across scenic vistas.\n\nX-THEME\n" +
            "The X-shaped LED taillights are not only for show. Striking, yet functional, this feature improves the cooling circuit of the mighty W16 Four vertical led headlights add a refined elegance to the superb looks of the roadster. Additionally, their three-dimensional surface helps to boost performance by reducing aerodynamic drag and evacuating the air from the wheel well.\n\n AMPLIFYING ENGINE SOUNDS\n" +
            "The dual engine air scoops amplify the W16’s unique sound. These roof-mounted intakes pay homage to the MISTRAL’s predecessors: the 1934 TYPE 57 ROADSTER GRAND RAID and the first modern-era open-top BUGATTI, the VEYRON 16.4 GRAND SPORT."

            ,"Bugatti has revealed this ornate one-off Chiron Super Sport ahead of Monterey Car Week called the \"Golden Era.\"\n" +
            "The Golden Era is a celebration of Bugatti's greatest hits as the company winds down production of the W-16 engine and transitions to an electrified future under new parent company Rimac.\n" +
            "Hand-drawn sketches of legendary Bugattis cover the car's sides; they took more than 400 hours to produce.\n" +
            "It’s become a cliché to call a sleek supercar a \"work of art,\" but in the case of the Bugatti Chiron Super Sport \"Golden Era,\" that title is particularly apt. This exquisite machine has been revealed ahead of its official in-person debut at the upcoming Monterey Car Week, sporting beautiful murals on the car's flanks that celebrate Bugatti's heritage.\nWhile the W-16 that has been Bugatti's hallmark only arrived in 2005 with the record-breaking Veyron, the customer wanted his masterpiece to feature important vehicles from throughout the brand’s 100-plus-year history. The images emerge on the front fenders and doors as the paint fades from the metallic Nocturne Black color to a light golden hue called “Doré” that is unique to this vehicle. On the passenger side, the 26 hand-drawn sketches include iconic cars like the Type 41 Royale and Type 57 SC Atlantic. There are also depictions of planes, a train, the company's chateau headquarters in Molsheim, and signatures from Jean and Ettore Bugatti."


            ,"The Bugatti Bolide is a track-only sportscar developed by Bugatti Engineering GmbH in Wolfsburg, Germany and manufactured in Molsheim, by French automobile manufacturer Bugatti Automobiles S.A.S., revealed online on October 28, 2020.\nThe main influence on the Bolide's light curb weight is due to the monocoque and all of its components constructed with titanium, along with nearly all of the body panels constructed in carbon fiber. Donning the aggressive design language of an LMP1 racecar (specifically the Bugatti Vision Gran Turismo concept, which preceded the Bolide), including the signature X-shape (itself inspired by the Bell X-1 aircraft), the aerodynamics of the Bolide help it generate more than 2,630 kg (5,800 lb) of downforce at 320 km/h (200 mph), with 1,810 kg (4,000 lb) at the rear wing and another 820 kg (1,800 lb) at the front wing. Additionally, the air scoop of the Bolide is home to a group of dimples, similar to what one finds in a golf ball, that raise up at high speeds, smoothing the laminar flow of air and reducing the aerodynamic drag of the scoop by 10% and a reduction in lift forces by 17%, according to Bugatti. The height of the Bolide, 100 cm (39.2 in), matches the height of the famous Bugatti Le Mans racecar."

            ,"The Bugatti Divo is a mid-engine track-focused sports car developed and manufactured by Bugatti Automobiles S.A.S. The car is named after French racing driver Albert Divo, who raced for Bugatti in the 1920s winning the Targa Florio race twice. It was revealed on 24 August 2018 at “The Quail – A Motorsports Gathering“ in California, United States.The car takes inspiration from the Bugatti Type 57SC Atlantic along with the Bugatti Vision Gran Turismo concept in terms of design and has track performance as its main focus. The car includes a redesigned exhaust system featuring quad exhaust pipes, a 1.8 metre wide fixed rear wing (23% wider than the retractable wing on the Chiron), a NACA duct on the roof that channels air to the rear of the car on a central fin and ultimately on the rear wing for improved downforce, a large front chin spoiler, more refined side skirts, larger air intakes on the front, new head lamps and tail lamps, a vent in the bonnet for improved radiator cooling and vents on the front wheel arches to cool the brakes.\n" +
            "\n" +
            "The interior in the Divo is relatively similar to the more luxurious Chiron, but has Alcantara upholstery and carbon-fibre trim in order to save weight."

            ,"Manny Khoshbin, a collector of exceptionally tasteful cars, just took delivery of this one-of-one Hermès Edition Bugatti Chiron bringing together the celebrated French luxury-goods designer and luxury-car specialist.\n" +
            "The limited-edition Chiron is dipped in Hermès Craie off white paint and has specially designed cashmere fabric on the door panels, one-of-one badges all around, and a special front horseshoe grille.\n" +
            "Khoshbin started collaborating with the two French brands in 2016.\n" +
            "California-based collector Manny Khoshbin has one of the most exclusive car collections in the United States. When Bugatti announced the Chiron, the 1500-hp replacement to the Veyron, in 2015, Khoshbin knew he wanted something more unique. To explain what \"unique\" means to this collector, he says he was recently offered the Chiron Super Sport 300+, but that wasn't exclusive enough. So, because of his passion for both the French luxury fashion brand Hermès and hyper-exclusive Bugattis, Khoshbin collaborated with the two French companies to build a one-of-one Hermès Edition Bugatti Chiron."

            ,"Bugatti customers appreciate the exceptional. With the recently completed Divo1 ‘Lady Bug’, the French luxury brand has once again demonstrated its high level of expertise in outstanding bespoke application and hand craftsmanship. In the timeframe of around two years, a very special Divo was created in close collaboration with one Bugatti customer, tailored with a one-of-a-kind custom paint scheme among other truly unique features. “The ‘Lady Bug’ was an exceptional challenge and at the same time an unforgettable experience. Due to the nature of the project, where a 2D graphic was applied to a 3D sculpture, and after numerous failed ideas and attempts to apply the diamonds, we were close to giving up and saying: ‘We cannot meet the customer’s request’,” explains Jörg Grumer, Head of Color & Trim at Bugatti Design. “However, it is our profound conviction that we should never give up and that our foremost motivation should always be to make the impossible possible for the customer. We are proud of the expertise we applied in creating this Divo: a high quality and complex product based on pure craftsmanship and outstanding teamwork between design and development.”"

            ,"Bugatti set the benchmark even higher with the plan of turning the supercar into a luxury road car suitable for everyday use. The development of the Veyron was one of the greatest technological challenges ever known in the automotive industry.\n" +
            "\n" +
            "Barely any parts, components or systems could be taken from existing car concepts and used in the Veyron. Everything had to be developed from scratch in order to achieve the performance specs and then everything had to be implemented in the car. The process also drew on the experiences of other industries in which materials and systems are routinely subject to extreme speeds and forces, such as aviation and space travel. The Veyron is the first – and the only – supercar to be developed and constructed with a series configuration that can master any driving scenario at any time. Even more than 15 years after its launch, the supercar is still setting benchmarks and inspiring emotion and enthusiasm across the globe.\n" +
            "\n" +
            "The Veyron 16.4 is completely sold out."

            ,"The Bugatti La Voiture Noire, a true marvel of automotive engineering and design, epitomizes beauty in its most extravagant form. From the sleek, aerodynamic contours that seamlessly flow across its body to the meticulously crafted details that adorn its every inch, this exceptional hypercar is a symphony of elegance and power. The exterior, draped in a bespoke black carbon fiber shell, not only enhances the car's performance with lightweight precision but also adds an air of mystique and sophistication.\n" +

            ,"The Bugatti Centodieci (Italian for \"110\") is a limited production mid-engine sports car produced by French automotive manufacturer Bugatti. The car is a homage to the Bugatti EB 110 and a celebration of the Bugatti marque's 110th birthday. It was revealed on 16 August 2019 at \"The Quail – A Motorsports Gathering\" in California, United States. ased on the Chiron, the car takes design cues from the EB 110 such as the five round air intakes which resemble a diamond and the wedge shaped design language. A small horse shoe radiator grille present below the headlamps further harks back to the EB 110. Narrow headlights with LED daytime running function and sharp grooves are used to create an aggressive appearance. The rear consists of eight tail lights along with matt-black quad exhaust pipes placed on either side of a large diffuser, complete with an underbody spoiler and a fixed overhanging rear wing. Due to the use of computer assisted 3D design techniques and the use of Virtual Reality technology, the design team was able to complete the design of the Centodieci in six months."

            ,"One of the most bizarre, elusive and expensive of cars is the Bugatti Type 57SC Atlantic. With its low stance, powerful engine, lightweight construction, 123 mph (200 kph) top speed and influential teardrop body, many believe this is the ultimate Bugatti and the first supercar ever made. Ettore’s son, Jean Bugatti, who played a large role in the development of the Type 57 series, personally styled the Atlantic. Jean’s lines draw an interesting mix of aircraft style together with the avant-garde tear-drop shape. Design highlights include a heavily raked windscreen, riveted fins and kidney-shaped doors with matching side windows. The 75 year history of each Bugatti Atlantic is entertaining conjecture for any Bugatti enthusiast. The first prototype is gone and only two of three aluminum bodied production versions remain largely original."

            ,"The Bugatti Chiron is a mid-engine two-seater sports car designed and developed in Germany by Bugatti Engineering GmbH and manufactured in Molsheim, France, by French automobile manufacturer Bugatti Automobiles S.A.S. The successor to the Bugatti Veyron, the Chiron was first shown at the Geneva Motor Show on 1 March 2016.The car's design was initially previewed with the Bugatti Vision Gran Turismo concept car unveiled at the 2015 Frankfurt Auto Show."

            ,"The Bugatti EB 110 is a mid-engine sports car produced by Bugatti Automobili S.p. A. from 1991 until 1995, when the company was liquidated. A small number of post-production cars were completed afterwards, with the last one built by Dauer in 2002 and another unfinished example completed in 2019. It was the only production model made by Romano Artioli's Italian incarnation of Bugatti. Development of the EB 110 started in 1987 on the engine and chassis, with work being carried out by Tecnostile, headed by Tiziano Benedetti, Achille Bevini, and Oliviero Pedrazzi. The trio had worked on the Lamborghini Miura chassis and engine development and had subsequently established their own company which was known to Ferruccio Lamborghini and Paolo Stanzani who were involved in early talks with Romano Artioli. Stanzani was chosen as company Technical Director thanks to his career experience with the Miura, Espada, and Countach."};

    public static String Bugatti_allmodel_spec[]={"The Bugatti W16 Mistral's engine and its specs need no introduction, but we'll give it one anyway. Dating back to the record-breaking Veyron, the 8.0-liter quad-turbocharged W16 found in the Mistral comes from the Chiron Super Sport 300+. In this incarnation, it produces 1,578 hp. Bugatti has not yet published acceleration or top speed claims, but considering that its last roadster - the Veyron 16.4 Grand Sport Vitesse - reached 254.04 mph and made \"only\" 1,183 hp, the Mistral should easily get closer to 300 mph. We estimate a 0-60 mph time of around 2.4 seconds.\n" +
            "\n" +
            "With 70,000 liters of air being fed through the engine every minute (at full bore) via air intakes behind the headrests, Bugatti says that the W16 Mistral provides an even more engaging connection between the driver and this engine.\n" +
            "\n" +
            "This legendary W16 is paired to a seven-speed dual-clutch automatic transmission, and power is directed to all four corners."

            ,"The Golden Era uses a Bugatti Chiron Super Sport as its base, which packs an 1578-horsepower version of the quad-turbocharged 8.0-liter W-16 and the special long-tailed carbon-fiber bodywork from the 300-mph Super Sport 300+. In our hands, the Super Sport shot to 60 mph in a blistering 2.2 seconds and only needed 14.8 seconds to crest the 200-mph mark."

            ,"The Bolide is built using the framework of the same 8-liter quad-turbo W16 engine and the 7-speed dual-clutch automatic transmission used in the Chiron, although upgrades to the W16 engine allow the Bolide to generate over 1,361 kW (1,825 hp; 1,850 PS) and 1,850 N⋅m (1,364 lb⋅ft) of torque, 183 kW (245 hp; 248 PS), more than the Chiron Super Sport 300+. This increase in power can be attributed to bigger blades in the turbochargers and the different orientation of the turbochargers themselves. Combining the fact that the curb weight of the car is only 1,240 kg (2,733.7 lb), the Bolide can accelerate from 0–100 km/h (62 mph) in 2.2 seconds, 0–200 km/h (124 mph) in 4.4 seconds, 0–299 km/h (186 mph) in 7.4 seconds, 0–401 km/h (249 mph) in 12.1 seconds, and 0–501 km/h (311 mph) in 20.1 seconds and a top speed projected of more than 501 km/h (311 mph). Additionally, Bugatti states that the Bolide has a 0–401–0 km/h (0–249–0 mph) of 24.62 seconds, and a 0–501–0 km/h (0–311–0 mph) time of 33.62 seconds. According to Bugatti, computer simulations show that the Bolide could lap the Nürburgring in 5 minutes and 23.1 seconds, making it just four seconds slower than the current record holder, the Porsche 919 Hybrid Evo. The Bolide is also simulated to have a lap time at the Circuit de la Sarthe of just 3 minutes and 7.1 seconds, making it 7.6 seconds quicker than the current record holder, the Toyota TS050, which lapped the circuit in 3 minutes and 14.7 seconds."

            ,"The car takes inspiration from the Bugatti Type 57SC Atlantic along with the Bugatti Vision Gran Turismo concept in terms of design and has track performance as its main focus. The car includes a redesigned exhaust system featuring quad exhaust pipes, a 1.8 metre wide fixed rear wing (23% wider than the retractable wing on the Chiron), a NACA duct on the roof that channels air to the rear of the car on a central fin and ultimately on the rear wing for improved downforce, a large front chin spoiler, more refined side skirts, larger air intakes on the front, new head lamps and tail lamps, a vent in the bonnet for improved radiator cooling and vents on the front wheel arches to cool the brakes.\n" +

A track-only special, its production will only be limited to 18 units, of which delivery will commence in early 2023. The P900 name is derived from the car\'s claimed dry weight, 900 kg (1,984 lb).",
            "The De Tomaso brand was acquired by Hong Kong–based Ideal Ventures in 2014, the same company who had acquired German automobile manufacturer Gumpert. Under the new management, work was started to revive the brand after a failed attempt in 2009. After an advertising campaign based on the company's history and some teaser videos of the new car in development under the code name \"Project P\", the company introduced the new sports car at the 2019 Goodwood Festival of Speed.[3] The new car, called the P72 uses a carbon fibre monocoque chassis constructed to LMP1 standards and is based on the Apollo Intensa Emozione. Unlike the Intensa Emozione, the car is meant to be a grand tourer.[4]",
            "The Shelby-De Tomaso “Prototipi” was known as the 'P70,' or ‘70P,' due to its planned 7 liter engine. However, over the course of the project the combination of two strong personalities and ulterior motives led to the dissolving of the relationship just before the cars completion. Shelby withdrew from the project as he was being enticed to turn his focus to the Ford GT40 race program and was displeased with the fact that he still had not seen his promised 7 liter engine.",
            "The prototype has a backbone chassis with stressed member engine and formula car suspension in a barchetta body constructed in Modena. Named the Vallelunga 1500 after the Autodromo di Vallelunga racing circuit, it was shown by De Tomaso at the Turin Auto Show in 1963 and subsequently raced.[1][4] Advertised in a prospectus as a Spider with weather equipment, Alejandro de Tomaso hoped to sell the concept to another company,[4] but when there were no takers he commissioned Carrozzeria Fissore to build a new aluminum body on his rolling chassis. Fissore presented the resulting coupé styled by its young design chief Franco Maina at the Turin show in November 1964. As many as fifteen were built,[5] the last few of which, unclaimed by De Tomaso, were scrapped by the coachbuilder.[6] In 1965 production was moved to Ghia where 50 were assembled with fiberglass bodies based on Maina's design.[2] In 1966 Ghia loaned a Vallelunga to the Museum of Modern Art in New York City for an automobile design exhibition.[7]",
            "The De Tomaso Pantera is a mid-engine sports car produced by Italian automobile manufacturer De Tomaso from 1971 to 1992.[1] Italian for \"Panther\", the Pantera was the automaker's most popular model, with over 7,000 manufactured over its twenty-year production run. More than three quarters of the production was sold by American Lincoln-Mercury dealers from 1972 to 1975; after this agreement ended De Tomaso kept manufacturing the car in ever smaller numbers into the early 1990s.",
            "The De Tomaso Guarà is a sports car and the last project the founder and owner Alejandro de Tomaso put into the market. Presented at the 1993 Geneva Motor Show, the Guarà was initially available in coupé body-style. Later a roadster and an open-top barchetta bodystyle became available. The latter corresponds to the coupé but without roof and proper windscreen; a small air deflector protects the passenger and the driver from the passing wind and the car had to be driven while wearing a helmet.",
            "The Mangusta replaced the Vallelunga model, on which its chassis was based.[3] The word \"mangusta\" is Italian for \"mongoose\", an animal that can kill cobras. It was rumored that the car was so named in retaliation to a failed deal between De Tomaso and Carroll Shelby.[4] Alejandro de Tomaso offered to help Carroll Shelby to build a new Can-Am race car at the end of 1964 when Shelby found that the Shelby Cobra would not be able to compete there. De Tomaso was planning to develop a new 7.0-litre V8 engine for racing so he saw this as a perfect opportunity. Shelby agreed to finance the project and also sent a SCCA approved design team headed by Pete Brock to Italy in order to handle the design work. De Tomaso had conflicts on the design of the car. He also failed to deliver the agreed 5 race cars within the deadline for the 1965 Can-Am season. This caused Shelby to eventually back out of the project and join the development team of the Ford GT40. Peter Brock and his team were able to finish the car according to their will. De Tomaso engaged Carrozzeria Ghia to finalise the design of the car which was being developed under the project name of P70. The single completed car was displayed at the 1965 Turin Motor Show as the Ghia De Tomaso Sport 5000. De Tomaso then modified the steel backbone chassis of the P70 and it became the basis for the Mangusta, which was designed by Giorgetto Giugiaro at Ghia. ",
            "The Competizione 2000 was one of several De Tomaso racing concepts produced during the mid 1960s. Few saw competition use but, along with myriad experimental engines, they illustrated De Tomaso’s engineering capability ahead of a hoped for tie up with a major manufacturer. Displayed at the Geneva Motor Show in March 1966, the Competizione 2000 was equipped with futuristic Ghia styling. It followed the Fantuzzi-bodied Sport 1000 / 66 which had been unveiled two weeks earlier at the Turin Racing Car Show.",

Named for its liquid essence, Hydroshade draws inspiration from the motor car’s noire character and possesses a reflective quality that mirrors natural light. In a discreet flourish, the reverse surface of the grille’s vanes are painted in True Love — a subtle detail that is only visible by way of indirect reflection. GLAMOUR DISTILLED\n" +
                    "With an intimate view of the parquetry fascia, driver and passenger recline into sumptuous seats decorated at the edges in dark red Mystery leather and light red True Love leather. The leathers are finished with a subtle copper shimmer, evoking the pearlescent texture of the Black Baccara rose petals. The enveloping interior and low seating position reinforce the motor car’s romantic character. Unsurprisingly, there was no Monroney price sticker stuck on the window of the Droptail, and it seemed gauche to ask the price. But if you're considering having Rolls build one for you, know that the previous commission, the Boat Tail, is rumored to have cost around $28 million, so we'd guess the Droptail is in the same neighborhood.",

The Spectre has a redesigned Spirit of Ecstasy; the flowing robes were reshaped for a realistic look, with a lower and more dynamic stance, which makes her more aerodynamic. The new Spirit of Ecstasy stands 83 mm (3.3 in) tall, compared to her predecessor's 100 mm (3.9 in).[5] This brings her much closer to the original drawings made in the early years of the 20th century.[6] This iteration of the Spirit of Ecstasy will appear on all future models succeeding the Spectre.",

The Wraith shares its nameplate with the 1938 model by the original Rolls-Royce company.The body style is a two-door pillar-less coupe with suicide doors, where all side windows can roll down like in a convertible. This body style was popular in American cars during the 1950s and 1960s, and was known as the hardtop body style, not used by Rolls-Royce since 1955.",

Inspired by coachbuilding of the 1920s and 1930s, the car was commissioned in 2013, by a super-yacht and aircraft specialist. At the time of its May 2017 debut at the yearly Concorso d'Eleganza Villa d'Este, it was the most expensive new automobile in the world, costing around £10 million. The Sweptail is owned by Hong Kong-based customer Sam Li, son of billionaire real estate mogul Samuel Tak Lee.Giles Taylor, former director of design at Rolls-Royce Motor Cars described the vehicle as \"the automotive equivalent of Haute couture\".[7]",
            "The Boat Tail is quite a sensory feast. This latest project by Rolls-Royce is one of only three commissioned nautical inspired custom-built motor cars. Walking around its elongated silhouette, the body appears as a singular clear surface, uninterrupted by panel breaks. At the rear, the sailing boat theme becomes clear. With a press of a button, in a gesture inspired by architect Santiago Calatrava’s cantilever concepts, the deck opens in a theatrically sweeping butterfly form to reveal an intricate hosting suite complete with a bespoke champagne chest, two bottles of Armand de Brignac vintage cuvée, caviar and blinis. Finally, cocktail tables open on either side of the deck providing access to a couple of picnic stools. The Boat Tail is all about these unexpected pleasures.",
